    <h2>Alphabet</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>The Japanese language is comprised of 3 different alphabets Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Hiragana is the most use alphabet due to the fact that most Japanese words are or can be in Hiragana.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Katakana is used for non-japanese words like foreign names or items.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Romaji is the alphabet that shows you how to pronounce every Japanese character for example: (る) romaji: RU.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Kanji is technically chinese but is used in Japanese writing, Kanji is used for writing nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>All 3 of these alphabets are used alongside each other to create grammaticaly correct sentences.</h3>

    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Most numbers in Japanese are made up of single digits, some are different for example hundered, thousand, million, and so on. Everything else is rather simple.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<div class="Pannel">
    <h2>Phonetics</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>This is how everything is pronounced as the Japanese language is rather complex in how everything is pronounced.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>A key example of this is the Hiragana character RU (る). <br><br> This is pronounced completely differently to how it looks. Pronouncing these types of characters correctly can take your Japanese skills to a whole other level</h3>
</div>
<br>

    <h2>Grammar</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>This is the understanding of how to structure sentences properly and having good grammar will take your Japanese to a whole other level.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>If you have a good understanding of grammar you will be able to hold a conversation with a native Japanese person and sounds like a native at the same time as long as your phonetics are in check.</h3>
